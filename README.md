# Ticket Broker

This project exists as a technology playground; however, a specific use-case has been selected to guide exploration.

## Use-case

The use-case which this project will attempt to implement (using various technologies) is the use-case of being a ticket
broker such as TicketMaster or StubHub.

User's should be able to acquire tickets directly from the broker.
Tickets can be directly sourced or may be sourced from other brokers/sources.

Ticket agents can reserve sets of tickets. The reservation system should automate the reservation process.

That, is the basic high-level use case.
